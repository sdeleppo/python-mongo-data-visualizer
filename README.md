## Overview
For a course project, I worked with rescue-animal training company, Grazioso Salvare, who sought a software application that works with existing data from animal shelters in their network to identify and categorize available dogs for specialized training. The result is a full-stack application which includes a database and a client-facing web application dashboard, through which users at Grazioso Salvare can access the database as a data table as well as visualize the data through interactive widgets. The interactive widgets include a geolocation chart showing the location of selected animals and a pie chart illustrating the variety of breeds based on the filtered data. This application was written in Python, and utilizes a MongoDB database.

## Animal Shelter Data Visualizer Discussion
### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
When initially developing code, one of my largest considerations is the reusability of said code. Especially when developing the backend tools to be used on the frontend dashboard, my main goal is to create a CRUD module that can be used throughout the dashboard and supplies all the functionality needed to communicate the data from the database to the browser. The advantage of this development style is that I cut down tremendously on rewriting code, I can reuse the tools I’ve already created in the backend to easily access and edit any data necessary, and display said data on the browser for the user. This allows me to use the CRUD module I developed in any MongoDB based application, as all I need to do is instantiate those tools and utilize them as needed on the frontend.
### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approached this problem keeping in mind that the tools I develop in the beginning will be utilized throughout the project. Because of this, this backend code acts as a base to build the entire project off of. With this initial code functioning seamlessly, frontend development is able to flow much more smoothly. I feel this is a good approach in most cases of development, it is always best to have a strong foundation to build your projects off of, this base allows for less bugs and easy fixes when they arise.
### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists are given a problem and develop solutions to efficiently solve said problem. I’d argue that problem-solving skills are the most invaluable trait a computer scientist could have, along with the tenacity to follow through. The work that we do provides not only solutions, but well-crafted solutions that solve the problem as well as possible. Computer science as a field in general provides a far more streamlined approach to sifting through data, these projects allow companies to do their work faster, efficiently, while being simplified for its users.
